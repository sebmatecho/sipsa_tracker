By connecting directly to an AWS RDS database, it offers up-to-date visualizations that help users analyze trends, fluctuations, and anomalies in product pricing across different cities and marketplaces. With features to compare regional differences, examine price volatility, and detect potential monopolistic behaviors, this tool is invaluable for researchers, policymakers, and businesses seeking to gain deeper insights into the factors influencing Colombia's food markets and understand economic implications for consumers nationwide.")
