# **SIPSApp: Exploring Colombian Food Prices** ü•ëüçñüìä  
#### by [S√©bastien Lozano-Forero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastienlozanoforero/)

## **Overview**

**SIPSApp** is a comprehensive data analysis platform that provides insights into food price dynamics in Colombia using weekly data published by **DANE (Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad√≠stica)**, the national statistical office of Colombia. This project automates the collection, cleaning, validation, and analysis of the **SIPSA (Sistema de Informaci√≥n de Precios del Sector Agropecuario)** dataset to provide data-driven insights into agricultural pricing.

### **Project Purpose and Importance**

The main goal of this project is to facilitate a deeper understanding of food price trends and **affordability** across various cities and marketplaces in Colombia. It aims to:
- Support policymakers in addressing **food security** and **inflation** concerns.
- Help businesses, farmers, and the general public to make informed decisions.
- Highlight regional disparities in food prices and trends that could be valuable for designing targeted interventions.

The project demonstrates the power of **data engineering** combined with **interactive data analysis** to explore real-world challenges in food markets.

### **What is SIPSA?**

The **[SIPSA](https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/estadisticas-por-tema/agropecuario/sistema-de-informacion-de-precios-sipsa)** (Sistema de Informaci√≥n de Precios del Sector Agropecuario) is a project managed by DANE that monitors and reports agricultural prices across Colombia's primary marketplaces. Each week, SIPSA releases reports on wholesale food prices, providing critical data to understand food price trends, market disruptions, and overall agricultural economics.

### **What Does This Project Do?**

The Food Prices Tracker automates the entire data processing workflow:
1. **Scraping**: Automatically downloads weekly food price reports from DANE's website.
2. **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Validates, transforms, and structures the data for analysis.
3. **AWS Integration**:
   - Uploads raw files to an **S3 bucket** for archival.
   - Stores cleaned data in a **PostgreSQL database** hosted on **AWS RDS**.
4. **Data Analysis & Visualizations**:
   - Provides interactive visualizations, including **price trends, affordability rankings,** and **price changes** over time using **Streamlit**.
5. **Data Quality Validation**: Ensures the integrity of city names, product names, price ranges, and trends for consistent and reliable analysis.

## **Project Features**

### **1. Automated Data Pipeline**
The project is a fully automated data pipeline for the collection, processing, and ingestion of SIPSA's weekly reports. It consists of:
- **Automated Web Scraping**: Weekly reports on food prices are downloaded from DANE‚Äôs official website.
- **Data Cleaning & Validation**: Cleaning the raw data, validating city and product names, and organizing it into structured formats.
- **Data Processing**: The system handles files in **Excel and CSV** formats and is capable of working with different structures such as multi-tab files.

### **2. Data Storage and Cloud Integration**
- **AWS S3**: Both raw and processed data are uploaded to AWS S3, ensuring data reliability, access, and storage.
- **AWS RDS**: A **PostgreSQL** database hosted on AWS RDS is used to store cleaned data for analysis.

### **3. Visualization Platform**
- **Streamlit Web Application**: The data analysis results are presented via an interactive **Streamlit** application. This app provides the following:
  - **Interactive Analysis**: Visualizations showcasing price trends, affordability rankings, city comparisons, and category-specific trends.
  - **Insights & Reporting**: Tools for examining **weekly price changes**, **seasonality**, and **affordability** at the regional level, allowing for an intuitive understanding of complex food market trends.

### **4. Recent Additions**
- **Price Change Detection**:
  - Recent features enable identifying **products with extreme price changes**, helping to track significant price increases or decreases between weeks. This helps stakeholders detect **market disruptions** or other anomalies.
- **Affordability Analysis**:
  - Users can see **top and bottom products** by affordability in a city, providing clear insights into **food affordability** for Colombian citizens.
- **Seasonality and Price Trends**:
  - Seasonal decomposition and price trend analysis, allowing stakeholders to understand **trends, seasonal effects,** and **market dynamics**.
